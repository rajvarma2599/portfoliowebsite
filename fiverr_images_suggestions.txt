Fiverr Gig Images Suggestions:

For your Fiverr gig "Professional UI/UX Design & Development for Mobile Apps and Websites", you need to provide 3 representative images. Here are my recommendations based on your portfolio projects:

Image 1: Mobile App Design Showcase
- Use a screenshot/mockup from your "Mobile App Redesign for Fitness Tracker" project
- Show the before/after comparison or key screens (dashboard, workout tracking, progress charts)
- Highlight the 40% engagement increase result
- Make it visually striking with the app interface prominently displayed

Image 2: Website Design Portfolio Piece
- Feature your "E-commerce Website UX Overhaul" project
- Show the checkout process or product discovery interface
- Emphasize the 25% cart abandonment reduction achievement
- Include wireframes vs final design comparison if possible

Image 3: Dashboard/Analytics Design
- Showcase your "Dashboard Design for SaaS Analytics Tool" project
- Display the data visualization and user workflow efficiency improvements
- Show how complex data is made accessible to non-technical users
- Include user personas or journey maps if they enhance the visual appeal

Image Creation Guidelines:
1. Use high-resolution screenshots (at least 1200x800px)
2. Add your branding/watermark subtly
3. Include brief text overlays highlighting key achievements
4. Ensure images are optimized for web (under 2MB each)
5. Use consistent styling across all three images

Alternative Image Ideas:
- Process diagram showing your UX methodology
- Before/after design transformations
- Client testimonial graphics with project results
- Technology stack visualization (Figma, HTML/CSS/JS icons)

Remember to upload images in JPG or PNG format, and ensure they clearly demonstrate your design capabilities and results.
